## Testing

First run `npm install`.
Then run `npm test` to lint `index.html` with HTMLHint.

## Work Samples

Video entries are defined in `index.html` using lightweight placeholders. Each
`div.video-wrapper` stores the embed URL in a `data-src` attribute and displays a
thumbnail image with a play button. To add a new video:

1. Copy an existing block inside the Work Samples grid.
2. Set `data-src` to the Vimeo or YouTube embed URL.
3. Update the `<img>` source to a suitable thumbnail (`https://vumbnail.com/ID.jpg`
   for Vimeo or `https://img.youtube.com/vi/ID/hqdefault.jpg` for YouTube).
4. Update the `data-title`, `alt`, and `aria-label` attributes for accessibility.
